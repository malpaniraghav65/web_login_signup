The Project Management System (PMS) is developed with the aim to make it as a standard 
system that can be used in the whole course for all campuses offering Engineering. The main 
focus of this article is to introduce the system designed, which was developed as a medium of 
interaction between lecturer, students and course coordinator in managing the projects process 
especially in the stage of project's proposal preparation. Two main elements applied in PMS are 
to manage the project and try to find similar project if the project is same the student should 
add for features or it will decline the project. In existing system, all hardcopy of the studentâ€™s 
project related documents such as project approval form, evaluation form, as well as the project 
progress validation form should be submitted to the course coordinator. This practice 
sometimes will cause unexpected problems such as loss of forms, lack of documentation 
storage space, delay of submission of forms and so on. Thismakes it difficult for the course 
coordinators to effectively manage the documentation especially if it involves hundreds of 
students at one time. The PMS system is developed using language of Dart Technology with 
Flutter Framework. The backend database is supported by Google Firebase easy to use, fast and 
reliable
